## Overview

FutureSDR supports *Blocks* with synchronous or asynchronous implementations for
stream-based or message-based data processing. Blocks can be combined to a
*Flowgraph* and launched on a *Runtime* that is driven by a *Scheduler*.

This library acts as a toolbox on top of FutureSDR to easily build your own flowgraph.

It is made by the community for the community.
